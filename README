A bunch of reusable "functions" implemented as Soar operators. Most functions operator on linked lists of the form:

^value a
^next
    ^value b
    ^next
        ^value c
        ^next nil

The usual functional list operations like map, fold-left, filter are implemented.

Everything is thoroughly tested with SoarUnit (http://code.google.com/p/jsoar/wiki/SoarUnit). To run the tests, get a recent version of the JSoar distribution (after 7/29/2010) and run SoarUnit like this:

$ soarunit --ui -R /path/to/bebot
